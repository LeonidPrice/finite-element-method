# Step 1: Matrix Calculations.

## Methods for working with matrices:

- **1. Generation of a unit matrix;**
- **2. Determining the rank of a matrix;**
- **3. Calculating the norm of a matrix:**
  - **3.1. First norm;**
  - **3.2. Infinite norm.**
- **4. Arithmetic operations on matrices:**
  - **4.1. Matrix addition;**
  - **4.2. Subtraction of matrices;**
  - **4.3. Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar;**
  - **4.4. Multiplication of a matrix by a matrix;**
  - **4.5. Elevation of a matrix to a positive degree.**
- **5. Finding the roots of the equation of the system of linear algebraic equations of the form Ax = B with respect to x. The algorithm is realized by the successive over relaxation (SOR) method;**
- **6. Transponing the matrix;**
- **7. Finding the determinant of the matrix by Gauss method with selection of the main element;**
- **8. Calculating the inverse of a matrix by the Schultz method.**
